My roots in programming and computer science go as far back as to my days in elementary school, playing around with QBasic and batch scripts. Hmmm... actually, I think I haven't yet told my parents I was related to our first computer stopping to function properly, some years ago...

I'm a fullstack/frontend developer, which means I can work E2E but my specialization is on the web frontend ecosystem - including CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and the browser environment in general.

I like helping others debugging their code or solving their issues, you can see me around on StackOverflow and various help forums.
