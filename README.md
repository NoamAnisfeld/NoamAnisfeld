My roots in programming and computer science go as far back as to my days in elementary school, playing around with QBasic and batch scripts.

I consider myself a fullstack/frontend developer, expertising in JavaScript, TypeScript, React and the browser ecosystem in general, but also holding knowledge in other server-side languages and tools.

I like helping others debugging their code or solving their issues, that's why I go to StackOverflow and other help forums. In my current job, I'm also mentoring software development students during their journey.

If you want to see an example of my programming style, I suggest viewing the following repository which belongs to a project still in development: https://github.com/NoamAnisfeld/Excercise-System-Front
